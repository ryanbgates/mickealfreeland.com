                <p>Mickeal Freeland was born April 26, 1985 in Round Rock, Texas, and later moved to Houston after his parents' divorce, where he grew up and first discovered his passion for acting. At the age of twelve, during a conversation with his brother and cousin about their futures, he declared, "I want to be an actor." That dream was solidified after being deeply inspired by Denzel Washington's performance in The Hurricane, and later by the standing ovation he received for a high school drama performance.</p>
                
                <p>His mother is his hero, his true inspiration, and the purpose behind why he continues to chase his dream. In 2012, when she suffered a massive stroke, he came close to losing her. The experience shook him deeply but also reminded him of a promise he had once made to her — to always pursue his dream of acting. That moment became the turning point that pushed him to commit fully to the craft. He began training at Kim Terry Studios, where Terry encouraged him to attend the Actors, Models & Talent for Christ (AMTC) showcase in 2013. During that week, he performed and developed his skills, ultimately earning a nomination for Best Actor. His performance caught the attention of agencies from Los Angeles, New York, and Atlanta, and he was awarded a scholarship at the showcase to attend the New York Film Academy's intensive summer bootcamp program in Los Angeles. In 2021, he continued strengthening his training in Houston with Ricky Catter, Deke Anderson at Next Level Studios, and the late Willie Dirden, where he studied the Meisner technique. Among his teachers, Willie had the most profound impact, shaping more than just his craft. Their bond was like that of a father and son. Before he passed, Willie prepared him for many auditions and leading roles, often reminding him, "Son, I'm not teaching you how to act, I'm teaching you how not to act." And perhaps his most lasting advice: "Don't ever go on set trying to be the best actor — go trying to be the most believable actor."</p>
                
                <p>His first on-screen roles came in the YouTube series What About Your Friends and the short film First Date in 2013. Since then, he has gone on to star in films such as Thirty Dirty, The Break of Dawn, Deliveries From Eva, and Three Days or Else, the latter alongside his late friend Samuel French. That performance earned him six Best Actor awards on the festival circuit and a Best Duo award shared with French. He has upcoming projects Titled Murder on The Blade, Towpath starring Academy Award nominated actor Eric Roberts.</p>
                
                <p>Though his work has received some recognition, He believes his true "big break" is still ahead. His dream collaborations include working with Denzel Washington and Leonardo DiCaprio, two actors he considers guiding inspirations.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond the screen, he draws strength from his Christian faith which guides all his decisions. He holds a strong love for his family which includes his mother, step mother, four brothers and two sisters, having faced the loss of one of his sisters to cancer at age seven and the passing of his father in 2014. These experiences, though difficult, continue to fuel his determination.</p>
                
                <p>A symbolic moment from his past still drives him today: at seventeen, on his last day working at  Tinseltown movie theater, a manager told him, "I better see you on one of these screens one day." To him, that was God's confirmation of his path because no one he worked with there knew he wanted to be an actor. He has carried those words ever since — and won't stop until they come true.</p>
